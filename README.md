# Assignment 5.1
This UC Berkeley Emeritus program assignment is all about cleaning, analysing a dataset, and presenting a dataset. 
The objective is to ask and answer a few important questions about the dataset and show the steps to reach conclusions.

## The Dataset
UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk:

Note: the UCI link was broken at the time this assignment was completed so I included this reference instead.

## Analysis Questions
Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
1. Analyze drivers over a certain age that go to bars for their responses to coupons.
2. Analyze drivers under the age of 25 who frequent coffee houses.

## Conclusion
In both cases, older bar visitors and younger coffee drinkers both will accept coupons more than the rest of the drivers in the sample.
